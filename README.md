###Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal of the project was create a weight tracking app. If was required to have a login in screen that the user could also creat an account on, a data screen for the users's inputted values, and a settings area where the suer could allow the app to send SMS messages. This app was meant to allow the user to track daily weights, input a goal weight, an get a notification when the goal weight was reached.

###What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
A login in screen with options for both signing in and creating an account was needed. A data secreen that displayed the users recorded weights and allowed for new weights to be entered or old weights to be edited was also needed. A settings page that allowed the user to opt into SMS notifications was added as well. A consitent color scheme was kept between the various screens to make sure the app felt cohesive. Buttons and edit text fields followed the android design guide to make sure users coudl easily access all elements of the apps. Elements were also labeled appropriately while being put in an expected order for the user.

###How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I printed out the different screens I had already created before starting to code. It made it easier to reference to elements on the screens while also allowing me to see the path I should be trying to follow in my coding. I also created a map of the app screens on my wall to see what made the most sense to connect where. I think I'll use this same technique for future apps, though I may divide the screens down into sub groups depending on how many are in the project.

###How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I used the built in emmulator in android studio to test the functionality of the app. This process was crucial as it showed me issues with fields getting incorrectly linked to writen functions in the code.

###Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I think I had to innovate every step of the procees. I originally proposed an app design that was much more complex than what I later realized I was capable of at this earlier stage. I later had to revise the plan I had original written for myself to fit within my capabilities as a devloper.

###In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think my abilities we well demostrated in my app layouts and the login user database codes.
